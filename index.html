             Overview 
        </h1>
        <p>Throughout America, there is a significant gap in our understanding of microhistory, a historical research method analyzing specific individuals to understand broader historical questions, surrounding American enslavement. Through dehumanizing the depiction of the enslaved, we withhold ourselves from a deeper grasp of their lives, continuing our restriction from our own historical understanding. Today, movies and institutionalized historical views are the prime representation of the “slave experience”. However, this “slave experience” diminishes their individuality and only represents the standard of an oppressed victim or a rebellion and solidifies the narrative embedded throughout America. However, studies from recent historians oppose the ideas enforced by the master narrative. They provide a deeper conceptual side of enslavement, offering a more refined grasp on our history, allowing for a more personal and humanized perspective on historical events. Breaking away from this single narrative crucially signifies our society’s social development, bringing awareness towards the reality of our history and using its mistakes to improve our nation’s future as we continue to dwell within a modern iteration of the same racist system it was founded. Through abandoning the master narrative and the racism embedded in the racialized system designed to dehumanize people of color, Americans can begin valuing one another as equals, free from the constraints of the superiority complex.

        <h1>While the dominant historical narrative of enslavement often reinforces a single perspective, incorporating insights from current historians provides individuals with an accurate and more refined understanding that challenges the master narrative and highlights the complexities of the enslaved’s humanity.</h1>

        <p><i>"It has been at the forefront of scholarship on slavery and the early Black Atlantic 
            for some time to understand Black women and men as historical subjects. <b>To not reduce them to one-dimensional 
            victims or revolutionaries, to understand the complexity of their personhood as we work to construct the processes 
            by which they defined themselves and built new communities. My own effort to name Black women as thinkers, as persons
             who brought analytic power to the uneven terrain on which they found themselves, is part of that effort. It is a 
             gesture on my part that is rooted in my concern that one-dimensionality is part of the afterlife of slavery, a part
              of the ongoing problem of racism and racial hierarchies.</b> If we can’t see Black people as complex historical actors
               from the distance of time, I fear that we will always be mired in the violence of misrecognition, in the 
               structures that reduce Black life and render people discardable." (Jennifer Morgan, Interview)</i></p> </div>

        <h1>Complexity of Personhood</h1>
        <p>Jennifer Morgan’s “complexity of personhood” concept challenges individuals to explore
             a better understanding of enslaved Africans’ humanity although the master narrative shapes our depiction of the ensla
             ved Africans through its continuous objectification of them. Morgan, a historian of African American experiences in colo
             nial America during the 16th and 17th century, focuses on the notion of understanding their humaneness because she values
              the significance of enslaved Africans’ contribution to our history not only as “historical subjects” but as intellectual a
              nd innovative beings who also contributed in the decomposition of institutionalized enslavement and the growth of
               communities through forms of rejecting the enforced power. </p>

    <div class="section" id="page6">
        <p>In the account of Hal Habert, he expands on the story of his brother, January, withholding from yelling in pain, as his 
        enslaver is beating him. Habert recollects that his brother <i>“neber said nothin’, and de massa keep a beatin’ till little
        streams of blood started flowin’ down January’s chest, but he neber holler. His lips wuz a quiverin’ and his body wuz a
        shakin’, but his mouf it neber open” </i>(Hal Habert, National Humanities Center).</p>


    </div>
    <div class="section" id="page7">
        <p>While January’s experience provides with a deeper view of the physical abuse the enslaved endured, it also 
            incorporates the intricacy of his mentality. Hearing the cries and screams of the enslaved builds up the enslaver’s 
            sense of power they obtain over them. Through beating and whipping the enslaved, enslavers used this form of abuse 
            to break their humanity down, seeking those cries that nourish their power over them and reinforcing the enslaved
             Africans identity of being property. However, from withholding from the pain of the whipping, January refuses to 
             appease his enslaver’s satisfaction, exemplifying his rejection of his enslaver’s power over him and his humanity.
              Seeing a depiction of January’s silence gives us a visual of the complexity of his character, using his silence as
               a form of taking away that power from his enslaver, reinforcing his own humanity through separating himself from 
               fulfilling that role of being property.  Through Hal and January Habert’s story, we can see how applying Morgan’s
                “complexity of personhood” concept leads us to expanding deeper into these vital details of history, making so 
                much of a difference when looking at the grand scheme of things, and how it differs from data points.</p>

        <h1>Qualitative and Quantitive Aspects of History</h1>
        <p>Jamelle Bouie, a columnist focusing on the historical context for present-day events, introduces the concept of 
            understanding the qualitative and quantitative aspects of history, expanding on the need of knowing the stories of 
            the enslaved while incorporating the expansion of the Atlantic Slave Trade System.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="page9">
        <p>“How do we wield these powerful tools for quantitative analysis without abstracting the human reality away from the 
            story?” (We Can’t See American Slavery for What It Is, Jamelle Bouie) </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="page10">
        <p>Through posing this question, he confronts how the single narrative of enslavement prominently illustrates 
            specifically the statistical part of enslavement through detailed analysis of spreadsheets and databases, but
             lacking the inclusion of the detailed analysis of the enslaved’s stories and depictions of their experience. Our 
             estrangement from these extremely vital stories of enslavement, leads us to incorporate the reduced depiction of 
             them as a part of their identity, being a non-human or an object. From his question, he challenges us to reevaluate
              why there is an uneven balance between what we know in the quantitive and qualitative part of history.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="page11">
        <h1>Bouie concludes his article with reinstating that “with history, the qualitative and quantitative must inform each 
            other” (We Can’t See American Slavery for What It, Jamelle Bouie)</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="page12">
        <p>Differing from the question he posed towards the beginning, he focuses more specifically on the contribution of both 
            concepts while studying the history of enslavement. Both components depend on one another to obtain an accurate 
            understanding. While only interpreting the quantitative side of the enslavement through evaluating spreadsheets we
             tend to only focus on the numbers of the people traded rather than focusing on the people and their stories. 
             Showing a form of reducing their stories down to this general stereotypical “story”, and essentially dehumanizing a
             ll of the millions of people’s experience to this single story. However, not incorporating the quantitative aspect 
             we’re shown stories of enslaved people’s experience but we aren't aware of how many lives were affected by these 
             course of events. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="page13">
        <h1>Additionally, Morgan states, “by examining numbers and feelings we move closer to understanding 
            both violence of such abstractions and the emotions”(2021 Duke University Press, Jennifer Morgan).  </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="page14">
        <p>As an extension of Bouie’s point, Morgan 
            agrees that the exploration of incorporating both aspects leads us to a better understanding of this extremely 
            complex history of enslavement and the people who were involved in it. Taking the time to incorporate both, expands
             our intellect of the people of the past and their adversity through such abuse and violence.</p>

        <h1>Family, A Form of Resistance</h1>

    <div class="section" id="page16">
        <p>Tera Hunter argues that the enslaved African American families were not only a form of resistance but one of the most
             vital expressions of defiance, nurturing their humanity, affirming their capacity for love and personal connection 
             despite the dehumanizing system of slavery.  From her concept, it gives us a depiction of the value of family for 
             enslaved people. Although, it doesn’t align with the overt forms of resistance, through rebelling and running away,
              through the notion of family it gave enslaved individuals freedom of their own humanity.From this documentary, I 
              learned that there are various different forms of resistance other than rebellion. Concerning resistance there are
               different forms of resistance including overt, an immediate end to enslavement for a person such as abortion or 
               rebellions, then there are everyday forms, a less visible way they resisted power such as stealing and breaking 
               tools. However, a variation of everyday resistance is through marriage and the development of families. Through 
               marriage and families enslaved people formed such valuable and strong bonds with people in their community. In 
               this way, they were resisting the oppression of their enslavement because their love for one another was a 
               variation of an escape from the bondage they endured. Given that people often tend to think that rebellion and 
               revolution was the best way to resist, as students we have to incorporate the fact that rebellion was at high 
               risk and great consequence and often extremely rare. Building families was an everyday form for enslaved people 
               to reach that grasp over self dependence to create something of their own. As a student, I am starting to value 
               families as the strongest form of resistance because for many people family bonds were the most important to them,
                igniting the risks and challenges they would take to protect them. Most importantly, having families shows 
                humanity and how they used love and affection as strength for their community, being human beings.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>As an African American woman, I’ve always seen the depiction of my ancestors being a form of commodity and categorized into being victims of institutionalized oppression. However, growing up I too adapted to this notion of thinking of enslaved Africans as historical objects and not considering their own individual experiences and stories, but rather subjecting them to this single story of being shipped from Africa to work day and night while being beaten. While the depiction I obtained isn’t wrong, it just singularly shows the simplification of such a complex history, and how there is so much more of the story than the master narrative that we have embedded in our brains. From learning about the concepts of enslaved individual’s “complexity of personhood”,  the balance between qualitative and quantitative aspects, and families as a form of resistance, I now understand how microhistory is an important aspect to improving our society. With more attention towards the significance of this approach of deepening our understanding, it offers an opportunity to abandon the master narrative we fuel from our own ignorance. Renouncing this narrative of dehumanizing and projecting one’s arrogance to others, develops our value for one another as humans and equals. Furthermore, bringing prosperity through our understanding and value for each other in our own society even within The College Preparatory School.
